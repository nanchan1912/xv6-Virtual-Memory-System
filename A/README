## xv6 (xv6-full-demand)

xv6 is a compact, instructional re-implementation of Unix Version 6 (v6).
This fork collects coursework, experiments, and targeted modifications
used for kernel-scheduling exercises in this workspace. The README below
helps you build, run, and demonstrate the changes quickly for interviews
or grading.

Why this fork is useful
-----------------------
- Focused on scheduler experiments and kernel instrumentation useful for
	systems coursework and technical interviews.
- Includes a concise patchset and example workloads so you can reproduce
	experiments, measure impact, and explain trade-offs.

What to highlight to a hiring manager
------------------------------------
- Kernel scheduling policy experiments (see `xv6/xv6_modifications.patch`).
- Per-process instrumentation (run/wait time and context-switch counts).
- Clean, minimal patchset designed for peer review and reproducibility.

Quick start — build & run
-------------------------
Prerequisites:
- A RISC-V cross toolchain (riscv-gnu-toolchain or equivalent) available
	in your PATH.
- QEMU configured with `riscv64-softmmu` (for `make qemu`).

From the xv6 folder:

```powershell
cd d:\IIITH\Projects\xv6-full-demand\xv6
make clean; make
make qemu
```

If your environment differs, use the Makefile targets available in that
directory (for example `make qemu-nox`).

How to explore the changes
--------------------------
1. Inspect `xv6/xv6_modifications.patch` to see all edits made by this
	 project. Apply to a clean xv6 tree with `patch -p1 < xv6_modifications.patch`.
2. Read `xv6/report.md` for experimental setup, metrics collected, and
	 high-level conclusions.
3. Look at the instrumented user program (`xv6/readcount.c`) and kernel
	 scheduler code (search for `scheduler`, `proc.c`) to see where metrics
	 are collected.

Testing & demonstration
-----------------------
- Run the provided workloads (see `xv6/report.md`) under both the
	stock scheduler and the modified scheduler and compare metrics.
- Use short, repeatable experiments (e.g., mix of CPU-bound and I/O-bound
	processes) to show fairness and throughput trade-offs.

Resume-ready bullets you can copy
--------------------------------
- Implemented and evaluated alternative scheduling policies in xv6; added
	per-process instrumentation and produced a reproducible patchset and
	results summary.
- Packaged changes for quick reviewer inspection: concise patch, report,
	and demo workloads.

Limitations & next steps
------------------------
- xv6 is a teaching OS: these experiments are illustrative and not
	production-grade.
- Next steps: add automated test harnesses, stress workloads, and support
	for parallel/concurrent client workloads when applicable.

License & attribution
---------------------
This repository is educational and builds on the original xv6 project.
Follow the upstream xv6 license and attribute accordingly when publishing.

Contact / follow-up
-------------------
Would you like this README adapted into a one-page slide, a short
resume-friendly blurb (2–3 lines), or a demo script that builds + runs
experiments automatically? I can add whichever you prefer next.

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu).  The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.1810, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu.  Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".
